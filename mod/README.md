# Overview

Tired of having so many different species to pamper? Now you can "assimilate" any of you bio-trophies into your original bio-trophy species via mandatory gene-therapy. The process is non-intrusive, but bio-trophies seem to be less-happy than usual while undergoing to process.

This mod was created by special request to reduce clutter on the species screen and Pop tab of the planetview.

# Changes

Adds the "Mandatory Gene-Therapy" living standard, available for species that have Bio-Trophy citizenship. Similar (but entirely outside) the assimilation process, bio-trophy Pops are slowly converted into your empire's original bio-trophy species. Not available for your original bio-trophy species - what would they turn into except themselves?

Bio-Trophies remain able to "work" bio-trophy jobs while undergoing mandatory gene-therapy, but they do not receive the same +40% bonus happiness as standard bio-trophies.

## Compatibility

Built for Stellaris version 3.8 "Gemini." Not compatible with achievements.

Implemented entirely via a new living standard and custom event. Should work with almost any other mod.

### When to Install

You can safely add this mod to your game after it has begun. It is likely safe to remove during gameplay - Stellaris will log some errors and should reassign the Mandatory Pampering living standard to any species that was using the custom living standard. Always back up your savegame before trying to remove a mod.

### Not Included in "Subtle Polish"

This mod is intentionally not included in my modpack [Subtle Polish: A Collection of Fixes and Enhancements](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2522974089) because this mod is not gameplay balanced. It is otherwise fully compatible.

### Development Notes

It is best to clone this repository into `<Stellaris User's Directory>/Paradox Interactive/Stellaris/mod`, and then make a connection to the `mod` folder via a `*.mod` file's `path` property.  That will ensure the game can see the files, and also that CWTools will parse them.  Also note that the README.md file exists in the `mod` directory but is symbolically linked in the root directory.
